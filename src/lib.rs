//!#Drive
//!A cross platform virtual file-system in userspace (drive) that will appear as a regular drive on the operating system.
//! The interface is a POSIX-like API and this is exposed in every OS. May include a webdav interface where possible.
//!IOS and Android etc. may require a driverless option and will require further consideration (webdav ?) to provide the
//! same cross platform/OS compatibility.
//!This drive can provide a blocking call to be used as a stand alone application or a threaded call to enable a drive to be mounted from any application.
